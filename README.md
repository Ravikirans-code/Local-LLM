Introduction
Streamlit is a powerful tool for creating web applications with minimal effort, and combining it with language models like Ollama allows for the creation of interactive, AI-powered applications. We’ll walk through setting up the environment, building the chat interface, and integrating the Ollama model to handle user queries.

1. Prerequisites
a. Python: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can download it from python.org.

b. Streamlit: Install Streamlit using pip

pip install streamlit
c. Ollama: To use and install models with Ollama, follow these steps:

Download Ollama: Visit the Ollama website and download the appropriate version for your OS.
List Models: Verify the downloaded models with ollama list.
Download and Run a Model: Execute the model with ollama run [model_name].
A. Setting Up the Virtual Environment
Before installing the required packages, it’s a good practice to create a virtual environment. This isolates your project and avoids conflicts with other packages.

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment:

Linux/MacOS:
source venv/bin/activate
Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
B. Installing Required Packages
Within the activated virtual environment, install the required packages:

pip install streamlit llama-index
2. Building the Chat Application
Now that we have our environment set up, let’s build the chat application. We’ll break down the code into manageable sections and explain each part. Let’s say that the name of our final code is “ollama-streamlit-app.py”.

a. Importing Libraries:
Firstly, we import the necessary libraries, including Streamlit for the web interface, logging for debug information, and time for measuring response times. We also configure logging to display informational messages, which helps in debugging and monitoring the application:

c. Streamlit App Setup:
This is the main function that sets up the Streamlit interface.


To run the streamlit app “ollama-streamlit-app.py”, type in your terminal the following shell command:

streamlit run ollama-streamlit-app.py
You can evaluate which models are faster and provide better answers by testing and comparing their response times and accuracy.
